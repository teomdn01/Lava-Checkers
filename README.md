# Lava-Checkers
 
 - Python based version of the checkers game

## Used conepts
- Model-View-Controller Layered Architecture
- Graphical User Interface
- Console User Interface
- AI - Implemented using the MiniMax Algorithm
- UnitTesting (>90% coverage for all functionalities)

## AI implementation description
- The AI analyses every possible move from the current
board state (using an evaluation function) and it tries to maximize
  the score of the move if it's his turn, or minimize it if it's the user's turn (The AI thinks 2, 3, 4 moves in advance, depending on the level).
  Hence, it decides which move is the most "profitable" for him
